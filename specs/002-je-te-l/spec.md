# Feature Specification: UI Design and Additional Features

**Feature Branch**: `002-je-te-l`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "je te l'aisse des captures d'ecran d'une autres app, et je voudrais que celle que l'on va faire y ressemble : /Users/rolandsebastien/Desktop/Capture\ d‚ÄôeÃÅcran\ 2025-09-26\ aÃÄ\ 11.38.28.jpeg /Users/rolandsebastien/Desktop/Capture\ d‚ÄôeÃÅcran\ 2025-09-26\ aÃÄ\ 11.38.44.jpeg /Users/rolandsebastien/Desktop/Capture\ d‚ÄôeÃÅcran\ 2025-09-26\ aÃÄ\ 11.38.50.jpeg , je veux aussi des notifications, des sauvegardes et export / import , que les tuiles du dashboard soit animes au survol, que dans une page avec une liste ( par exemple les candidatures envoyes) que je puisse faire un swipe gauche qui m'affiche les icones pour modifier, un apercu, exporter et supprimer"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an IT professional, I want the app's user interface to resemble the design from the provided screenshots, including animations on dashboard tiles, swipe gestures on lists for actions, and features like notifications, data backups, and export/import, to provide a polished and efficient user experience.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** screenshots are provided, **When** designing the UI, **Then** the app's layout and style MUST match the screenshots.
2. **Given** dashboard tiles are displayed, **When** the user hovers over a tile, **Then** the tile MUST animate.
3. **Given** a list page with items (e.g., sent applications), **When** the user swipes left on an item, **Then** action icons for modify, preview, export, and delete MUST appear.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the provided screenshots are not accessible or viewable?
- How does the system handle failed swipe gestures or animations?
- What if export/import operations encounter errors?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST replicate the UI design and layout from the provided screenshots.
- **FR-002**: System MUST support displaying notifications to the user.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow exporting user data to external formats.
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow importing user data from external formats.
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide backup functionality for user data.
- **FR-006**: Dashboard tiles MUST animate when hovered over.
- **FR-007**: List items in pages (e.g., applications) MUST support left swipe to reveal action icons: modify, preview, export, delete.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Notification**: Alerts or messages displayed to the user.
- **Backup**: Saved copies of user data for restoration.
- **Exported Data**: User data in formats suitable for external use or sharing.
