# Feature Specification: Automated Build on Feature/Task Addition

**Feature Branch**: `003-et-je-veux`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "et je veux aussi que a chaque ajout d'une feature ou d'une task que l'app soit builder dans le terminal afin de voir si cela compile bien et de corriger rapidement si le build is failed"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want the app to be automatically built in the terminal whenever a feature or task is added, so I can immediately check for compilation issues and fix them quickly if the build fails.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new feature is added, **When** the addition process completes, **Then** the app MUST be automatically built and the result displayed in the terminal.
2. **Given** a new task is added, **When** the addition process completes, **Then** the app MUST be automatically built and the result displayed in the terminal.
3. **Given** the build fails, **When** the build completes, **Then** the user MUST be notified of the failure to correct errors.

### Edge Cases
- If build command is not available, notify the user.
- Build failure is indicated by error messages.
- How does the system handle long build times or interrupted builds?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically trigger a build after adding a feature.
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically trigger a build after adding a task.
- **FR-003**: Build output MUST be displayed in the terminal.
- **FR-004**: If the build fails, the system MUST notify the user to correct compilation errors.
- **FR-005**: System MUST use xcodebuild as the build command.
- **FR-006**: Build failure MUST be detected by the presence of error messages in the output.
- **FR-007**: If xcodebuild is not available, the system MUST notify the user.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Build Result**: Represents the outcome of the build process, including success or failure status.
- **Feature**: A new feature added to the project.
- **Task**: A new task added to the project.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: What build command should be used to compile the app? (e.g., xcodebuild, swift build) ‚Üí A: xcodebuild
- Q: What constitutes a build failure? (e.g., non-zero exit code, specific error messages) ‚Üí A: error messages
- Q: What information is included in the Build Result? (e.g., success/failure status, output logs) ‚Üí A: success/failure status
- Q: Are there performance targets for build time? (e.g., <30 seconds, or none) ‚Üí A: none
- Q: How to handle if build command is not available? (e.g., skip build, notify user) ‚Üí A: notify user
