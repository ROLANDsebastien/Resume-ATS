# Research Findings: Automated Build on Feature/Task Addition

## Decision: Use xcodebuild for automated builds
Rationale: Clarified in spec that xcodebuild is the build command for the Swift/macOS app. It's the standard tool for Xcode projects.

Alternatives considered: swift build (not suitable for Xcode projects with UI), manual builds (not automated).

## Decision: Detect build failure by error messages in output
Rationale: Spec clarifies that build failure is indicated by error messages, allowing parsing of terminal output.

Alternatives considered: Exit codes (but user specified error messages).

## Decision: Notify user if xcodebuild unavailable
Rationale: Spec requires notification if command not available, to inform developer.

Alternatives considered: Skip silently (not user-friendly).

## Decision: Build Result entity includes success/failure status
Rationale: Spec limits to status, keeping simple.

Alternatives considered: Include full logs (but spec says status).

## Decision: No performance targets for build time
Rationale: Spec states none, so no optimization needed.

Alternatives considered: Set targets (but not required).
